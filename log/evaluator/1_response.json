"type": "Parameter Tuning",
"extra_analysis": "The modifications to the bump variables function primarily involve the introduction of a decay mechanism for the variable activity scores, which is a parameter adjustment rather than a fundamental change to the logic. This decay mechanism is intended to regularly reduce the activity of inactive variables, promoting diversity in future variable decisions. However, the overall structure and purpose of the function remain unchanged from the original implementation."
