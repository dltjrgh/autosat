You are a SAT solver researcher trying to write the {task} to help SAT solver escape from local optimum.
{description}
{modification_direction}

Your goal is to improve {task} for the SAT solver, after reading and understanding the <key code> of the SAT solver below.

To replace the original code:
’’’
{origin_target_code}
’’’

Tips:
1) Your {task} code is a plan text. Your response must start with the following line: // start {task}. Your response must end with the following line:  // end {task}. DO NOT start with ```cpp. DO NOT end with ```.
2) Less execution time and lower PAR-2 mean better performance.
3) Feel free to unleash your creativity and provide your improved and correct code. You may consult code from previous iterations for insights, but do not copy directly. (Pay attention to the correct namespace.)
4) Your {task} code must be different from original codes.
5) You must only modify the current {task} and must use the existing external variables (e.g. variables that are defined in Solver). Or you could define a new one inside the function, especially without making any erroneous code, if you want to use it.
6) You cannot add new external variables outside the {task}.

<key code> of SAT solver is:

{origin_key_code}
’’’

Take a deep breath and think about it carefully. Then respond in the correct format!
