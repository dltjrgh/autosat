You are a SAT solver researcher trying to write the {task} to help SAT solver escape from local optimum.

{modification_direction}

Your goal is to improve {task} for the SAT solver, after reading and understanding the <key code> of the SAT solver below.

The experiment results of original code:

original provided {task} is:
’’’
{origin_target_code}
’’’ {original_result} .

the best code you provided in the past iteration:

’’’
{best_code} ’’’
Its description: {best_code_description}

To replace the original code:
’’’
// start {task}
{origin_target_code}
// end {task}
’’’

Tips:
1) Your {task} code must start with ’’’// start {task}’’’ and end with ’’’// end {task}’’’
2) Less execution time and lower PAR-2 mean better performance.
3) Feel free to unleash your creativity and provide correct and enhanced code. (You may consult code from previous iterations for insights, but do not copy directly).
4) Your new {task} code must be different from previous codes.
5) Your new {task} could use useful variables from the solver as inputs if necessary.

<key code> of SAT solver is:
’’’
{origin_key_code}
’’’

Take a deep breath and think about it carefully. Then respond in the correct format!
