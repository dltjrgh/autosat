Your goal is to write a bump variables function for the SAT solver that will help it restart the search and escape from the local optimum, after reading and understanding the <key code> of SAT solver below.

Your answer must follow the following JSON format:
{
"description":"Provide a concise yet accurate description of the bump variables function and show its application ( also include key variables.);",
"modification_direction":["some possible directions to improve the bump variables function, feel free to explore!"]
}

Tips:
1) You must traverse all possible position of <key code> if you want to modify the bump variables function
2) You need to give us some advice to modify the bump variables function. e.g. some potential directions to change the heuristics. (The directions should be feasible)
3) Notice that, you can only change bump variables function.

<key code> of SAT solver is:
"""
void Solver::bump_var(int var, double coeff) {
    if ((activity[var] += var_inc * coeff) > 1e100) {           // Update score and prevent float overflow
        for (int i = 1; i <= vars; i++) activity[i] *= 1e-100;
        var_inc *= 1e-100;}
    if (vsids.inHeap(var)) vsids.update(var);                 // update heap
}
"""
Take a deep breath and think about it step by step. Then respond strictly in pure JSON format!
